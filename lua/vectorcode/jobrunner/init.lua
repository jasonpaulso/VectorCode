local utils = require("vectorcode.utils")

--- A class for calling vectorcode commands that aims at providing a unified API for both LSP and command-line backend.
--- Implementations exist for both direct command-line execution (`cmd.lua`) and LSP (`lsp.lua`).
--- For the format of the `result`, see https://github.com/Davidyz/VectorCode/blob/main/docs/cli.md#for-developers
---@class VectorCode.JobRunner
--- Runs a vectorcode command asynchronously.
--- Executes the command specified by `args`. Upon completion, if `callback` is provided,
--- it's invoked with the result table (decoded JSON from stdout) and error table (stderr lines).
--- The `bufnr` is used for context, potentially to find the project root or attach LSP clients.
--- Returns a job handle (e.g., PID or LSP request ID) or nil if the job couldn't be started.
---@field run_async fun(args: string[], callback:fun(result: table, error: table)?, bufnr: integer):(job_handle:integer?)
--- Runs a vectorcode command synchronously, blocking until completion or timeout.
--- Executes the command specified by `args`. Waits for up to `timeout_ms` milliseconds.
--- The `bufnr` is used for context, potentially to find the project root or attach LSP clients.
--- Returns the result table (decoded JSON from stdout) and error table (stderr lines).
---@field run fun(args: string[], timeout_ms: integer?, bufnr: integer):(result:table, error:table)
--- Checks if a job associated with the given handle is currently running.
--- Returns true if the job is running, false otherwise.
---@field is_job_running fun(job_handle: integer):boolean
--- Attempts to stop or cancel the job associated with the given handle.
---@field stop_job fun(job_handle: integer)
--- Optional initialization function. Some runners (like LSP) might require an initialization step.
---@field init function?
